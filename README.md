<!-- Features -->

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- [x] Object-Oriented Design: The project follows object-oriented principles, such as inheritance and encapsulation, to create well-structured and organized code for handling name-related tasks.
- [x] Enhanced Flexibility and Maintainability: By employing the decorator pattern and an abstract class, the project achieves enhanced flexibility, code reusability, and maintainability when dealing with name-related functionality.
- [x] Decorator Pattern Implementation: The project utilizes the decorator pattern to dynamically add or modify behavior to Nameable objects. Two specific decorators, TrimmerDecorator and CapitalizeDecorator, are created to preprocess names before validation.

### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] Database Integration: Implement a database integration to store and preserve data in a persistent manner. Choose a suitable database system and create appropriate tables to store Person, Address, and other relevant data.
- [ ] Test Driven Development (TDD): Encourage TDD practices, where new features are first defined by writing tests and then implemented to pass those tests. This approach ensures that code changes are well-tested from the start.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. Ensure you have Ruby installed on your system. You can check your Ruby version in the terminal by running:

```ruby -v```

If Ruby is not installed, you can download and install it from the official Ruby website.

2. To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.
Choose the directory on your local machine where you want to copy project. For example:

> cd /home/user/name-of-your-directory

Clone the project using one of the options.

Using SSH-key:

> git clone git@github.com:romans-adi/school-library.git

Using HTTPS:

> git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/school-library.git

You can also create the new directory just adding the name of it in the end of command. For example:

> git clone https://github.com/romans-adi/school-library.git enumerable

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the Enumerable repository.

3. Run the following command to install any required dependencies (in this case, we assume there are no external dependencies, so this step may not be needed):
```bundle install```

### Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Once the setup is complete, ensure you are still in the directory containing the Morse Decoder files.

2. To run the app, execute the following command:

```ruby main.rb```

3. The decoded message will be displayed as the output.

4. If you have future features like GUI or interactive mode, follow the specific instructions provided for those features in the app's documentation.
